# SVN Basic Commands

Some basic SVN commands that are different from Git, since SVN does not have the concept of local/remote repository:

Git | SVN | SVN short-codes
--- | --- | ---
`git status`| `svn status` | `svn st`
`git clone` | `svn checkout` | `svn co`
`git push`  | `svn commit` | `svn ci`
`git pull`  | `svn update` | `svn up`
`git fetch` | `svn update` | `svn up`
`git checkout` | `svn switch` | `svn sw`
