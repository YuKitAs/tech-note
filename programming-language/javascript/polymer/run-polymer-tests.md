# Run Polymer Tests

Basically there are two ways.

1. Use `polymer test` and `Web Component Tester` will run all the tests against all the browsers. To specify a single browser, say `Chrome`, use:

    ```console
    $ polymer test -l chrome
    ```

2. Directly run a test file from the IDE in the default browser, or go to the URL of the test file in a browser, and then use `F12` to inspect or debug.
