# Troubleshooting


## Print Warping

**Problem**: the first layer curls up at corners

**Cause**: the prints cool unevenly, which leads to different tensions

**Solutions**:

1. Improve bed adhesion:

* Use a heated bed

* Use adhesives like hair spray or glue stick

2. Adjust slicer's settings:

* Decrease the print speed

* Increase temperature for the first layer

* Turn off or lower the speed of the fan for the first layer

* Add brim or raft or mouse ears under the print
