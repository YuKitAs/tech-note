# Create Desktop Shortcut For JetBrains IDEs

In Linux, after downloading and untaring a JetBrains IDE one can only run it from the shell script. The simplest way is to create an application launcher on the desktop is to set `Tools -> Create Desktop Entry` in IDE menu. It will create a shortcut in the system menu (usually under `Development`), then choose `Add to Desktop` by right-clicking the shortcut.

As well as `Tools -> Create Command-line Launcher` for creating a command-line launcher.
