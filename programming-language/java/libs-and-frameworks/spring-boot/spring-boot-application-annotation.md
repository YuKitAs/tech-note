# `@SpringBootApplication` Annotation

`@SpringBootApplication` is an annotation that combines the following annotations:

* `@Configuration`: tags a class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

* `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: adds beans based on classpath settings, other beans and property settings.

* `@ComponentScan`: looks for other components, configurations and services in the package.
