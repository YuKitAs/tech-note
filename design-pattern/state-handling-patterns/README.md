# State Handling Patterns (Zustandshandhabungsmuster)

Bearbeiten den Zustand von Objekten, unabhängig von deren Zweck.

* __Flyweight (Fliegengewicht)__:

A Flyweight is an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects.

* __Memento__:

The Memento pattern provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

* __Prototype (Prototyp)__:

The Prototype pattern is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

* __Singleton (Einzelstück)__:

The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

* __State (Zustand)__:

The State pattern implements a state machine in an object-oriented way.
