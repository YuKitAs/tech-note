# Custom Metrics


Spring Boot 2.0 has integrated [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) into Spring Boot Actuator to collect metrics, together with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)(see metrics format in [note](https://github.com/YuKitAs/tech-note/blob/master/monitoring/prometheus-metrics.md)) which stores metric data, we can define and integrate custom metrics to various monitoring systems like Grafana.
