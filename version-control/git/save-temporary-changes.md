# Save Temporary Changes

1. `git stash`

    Used to save uncommitted changes (in already added files). They can be listed with `git stash list`.

2. `git pull --rebase`.

    Pull changes without creating a separate branch.

3. `git stash apply` or `git stash pop`

    Re-apply the stashed changes to the working branch. The difference is that the changes would be kept in stash or removed.
