# Use Icons From Vector Asset

In Android Studio, we can add default icons from Vector Asset into `drawable`. Right-click `res` directory, choose `New > Vector Asset`, we can either search for a default icon from `Clip Art` or upload a local icon file. After we have configured the icon properly, a `xml` file for the icon will be generated in `res/drawable`, which we can refer in the layout.
