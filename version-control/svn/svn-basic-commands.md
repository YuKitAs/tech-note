# SVN Basic Commands

Some basic SVN commands that are different from Git, since SVN does not have the concept of local/remote repository:

Git | SVN
 --- | ---
 `git clone` | `svn checkout`
 `git push` | `svn commit`
 `git pull` | `svn update`
 `git fetch` | `svn update`
 `git checkout` | `svn switch`
