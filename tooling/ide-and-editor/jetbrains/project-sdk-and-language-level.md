# Project SDK and Language Level

Open `File > Project Structure...` (or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S`), we can change the `Project SDK` and `Project language level` for the current project.

The default global settings can be found in `File > Other Settings > Default Project Structure...`, these will be applied to newly created projects.
