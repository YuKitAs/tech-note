# Hard Wrap with Max Line Length

In `Settings > Code Style`, set the max line length (columns) in the field `Hard wrap at`. Choose a specific language, for example, `Code Style > Java > Wrapping and Braces`, make sure `Ensure right margin is not exceeded` is selected. Then try to use `Ctrl+Alt+L` to reformat code, the code lines that exceed the max line length will be automatically wrapped.
