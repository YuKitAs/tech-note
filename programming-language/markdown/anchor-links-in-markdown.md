# Anchor Links in Markdown

In Markdown each heading is automatically generated with an anchor in front of it. For example, we have a heading `## Hello World` in `README.md`, then we can create a reference like

```markdown
* [Hello World](#hello-world)
```

so that it will link to `https://github.com/YuKitAs/repository-name#hello-world`.
