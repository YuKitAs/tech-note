# Import Generated Classes

Normally, IntelliJ won't resolve generated classes. Take Maven project as example, if we want to import generated classes from `target/generated-sources/`, we have to go to `Project Structure > Modules` and mark the corresponding package (e.g. `target/generated-sources/annotations`) as `Sources`.
