# Copy Layer to New Image

To copy a layer to a new image there are different ways.

## Copy & Paste

1. Create a new image with appropriate canvas size.

2. `Ctrl + A` to select all the layer and `Ctrl + C`.

3. In the new image, `Ctrl + V` and then right-click the generated `Floating Selection`, and choose `New Layer...`. The layer will be named `Pasted Layer`.

## Drag & Drop

1. Create a new image with appropriate canvas size.

2. Hide the layers which shouldn't be copied.

3. Drag the **tab** to the new image and drop it on the canvas. The layer will be named `Dropped Buffer`.
