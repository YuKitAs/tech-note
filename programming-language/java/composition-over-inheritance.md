# Composition over Inheritance

Composition over inheritance is a principle of OOP that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by containing references to an instance of other class rather than inheriting from a parent class, because inheritance violates encapsulation and could lead to fragility in subclasses as the subclasses need to depend on the implementation details of its superclass.
