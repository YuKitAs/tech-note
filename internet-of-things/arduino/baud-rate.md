# Baud Rate

Baud rate in Arduino is the serial data transmission rate in bits per second. For communicating with the computer, the following rates can be specified: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, or 115200 in `Serial.begin(speed)`. 9600 (bps) is the standard rate which is usually used.

In the Serial Monitor, if selecting a baud that doesn't match the baud specified in code, the output won't be displayed correctly.
